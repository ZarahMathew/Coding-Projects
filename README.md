**Introduction to Computer Programming Projects**

[Gamification.py](https://github.com/ZarahMathew/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Programming/gamify.py): The goal is to create a simulator for an app that encourages the user to exercise more by awarding “stars” to the user for exercising.
<br>
[Gomoku.py](https://github.com/ZarahMathew/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Programming/gomoku.py): Created an AI engine for the game Gomoku on a 8x8 board.
<br>
[synonyms.py](https://github.com/ZarahMathew/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Programming/synonyms.py): Created a mini "word meaning" engine that automatically decides which words are similar based on the text it reads. 


**Computer Algorithms and Data Structures Projects**

[autocomplete.c](https://github.com/ZarahMathew/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Computer%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/autocomplete.c): The goal is to implement an autocomplete feature. This is accomplished by loading a list of weighted search terms from a file, sorts them alphabetically, uses binary search to find the first and last term that match a given prefix, then returns all matching terms sorted by highest weight.  
<br>
[seamcarving.c](https://github.com/ZarahMathew/Coding-Projects/blob/main/Computer%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/seamcarving.c): Implemted vertical seam-carving by computing each pixel's "energy" using the dual-gradient method. It uses dynamic programming to find the lowest-energy connected path from top to bottom (the seam), reconstructs the seam, and then creates a new image with one column removed by skipping the seam pixels.
